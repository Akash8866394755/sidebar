I've finally finished my javascript studying phase and am able to design a responsive sidebar.
These responsive sidebars are typically found in huge online applications, and for a better look, I've included a great animation here.
The animate.style library greatly assisted me in this project to achieve better animation effects, and I am fully attributing all credit to them.
